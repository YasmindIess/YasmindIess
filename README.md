# GmGm!!!
### I am a context engineer for full stack decentralized AGI development.
### Building on Gravity Chain for the future of the Web3 and $GG.
## Focusing:
Currently running a dApp proposal on [Galxe DAO](https://dao.gravity.xyz/#/);
the GP43 [Enhanced Tokenomics Simulator](https://dao.gravity.xyz/#/proposal/0xf84a6424728ddd94ba83635c3f9e34b45f5443c929ef3be9ede95c118b8e353d) - An educative dApp for token economies research and simulation.

# Minding business that is:
- Developing AI agents that runs onchain, produce decentralized applications, regulates them, and maintain as a expert team.
- Unifying multiple services, sources & resources into interoperable solutions, all using free tiered agentic development tools.
- Systematically enhancing and improving both the technology, community, and intelligence of web3 ecosystems.
- Kind exceeding on being lazy and doing the maximum with minimal effort, all while aiming perfection to reach excellence.
